    <h1>Counting Down...</h1>
    <div id="question-body">
      <p>
        Modify this page so that the following animation starts when the button
        is clicked. Every second, the number with id
        <code>"number"</code> should decrease by 1. When the number reaches 0,
        the number <span class="red">0</span> should be displayed in
        <span class="red">red</span> color. Then the number should be reset to
        10 in black color and start a new round of counting down.
      </p>
      <div class="question-second">
        <p id="result">10</p>
        <p>
          <button id="btn">Count Down</button>
        </p>
      </div>

    <script>
      let n = 10; // starting from 10
      const result = document.getElementById("result"); //it will show the counter here

      function countDown() {
        result.innerHTML = n; //since n is going to be changing, the result is n (whatever n is)
        result.style.color = "black";

        if (n == 0) {
          // when n reaches 0, n = 11 so we can start all over at 10 because it would subtract one from it
          result.style.color = "red"; //make 0 (the result) change to color red
          n = 11; //and make n be 11 so we can start all over
        } n--; //if we would have else here, it would make it stop at 0, but instead it makes it keep going
          setTimeout(countDown, 1000);
